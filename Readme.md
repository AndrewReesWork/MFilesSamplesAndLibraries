# M-Files Samples and Libraries

*Please read the attached LICENSE file for detailed information.*

This solution contains a series of libraries and samples to help developers build applications using [M-Files](http://www.m-files.com).  These libraries and samples are designed to sit alongside our dedicated [M-Files Developer Portal](http://developers.m-files.com), where further information on the APIs and Frameworks that M-Files expose can be found.

Whilst the code aims to be as compatible as possible, please note that this is currently tested using the following configuration:

* The latest public M-Files build (currently M-Files 2015.3 SR2)
* Visual Studio 2015 Update 3

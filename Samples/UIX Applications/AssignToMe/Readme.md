# Creating assignments on button click

This application registers a [ShellUI module](http://developer.m-files.com/Frameworks/User-Interface-Extensibility-Framework/Modules/#shellui) that creates an "Assign to me" button.  The button is only shown when at least one object is selected.  When the button is clicked, an assignment is created for the selected object(s), and assigned to the current user.

This application is compatible with M-Files Web Access as well as M-Files Desktop.

# Persistent Web Page

This application registers a [ShellUI module](http://developer.m-files.com/Frameworks/User-Interface-Extensibility-Framework/Modules/#shellui) that creates a persistent web page and shows the content within a tab on the right-hand-side of the interface.  The navigation within the tab is persisted even as the user interacts with M-Files (e.g. by navigating into a view).

More information is available within the [M-Files Developer Portal](http://developer.m-files.com/Samples-And-Libraries/Samples/User-Interface-Extensibility-Framework/Display-Persistent-Web-Page-In-Tab/).

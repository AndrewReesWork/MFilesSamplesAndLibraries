# M-Files Samples

The following samples are available in this solution:

* M-Files API
  * Searching
    * `Segmented Search` - An example to show how to bypass the default search limitations of [SearchForObjectsByConditions](https://www.m-files.com/api/documentation/latest/index.html#MFilesAPI~VaultObjectSearchOperations~SearchForObjectsByConditions.html) or [SearchForObjectsByConditionsEx](https://www.m-files.com/api/documentation/latest/index.html#MFilesAPI~VaultObjectSearchOperations~SearchForObjectsByConditionsEx.html) by instead searching for "segments" of objects from the vault.
* Vault Application Framework
  * `Chain Workflows` - An example to show how to move an object to a second workflow once it reaches the end of a first workflow.
